<h3 id="course-objectives">Course objectives</h3>
<p>The student is able to describe the basic principles and technologies
of cloud services. The student is able to name some uses of cloud
services. The student is able to name the advantages and disadvantages
of cloud services.</p>
<p>Entire course is independent self-studies and research from provided
sources, writing mini-essays and peer reviewing answers. There are
alternative hands-on assignments for those who prefer coding and testing
services instead of writing essays. This course is also in <a href="https://campusonline.fi/">CampusOnline.fi</a>. This is not a
non-stop course in CampusOnline or elsewhere, but follows clear schedule
due final peer reviews.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
<li>Generic IT, study and research skills to pass the course. Good IT
skills for grade improving or alternative hands-on assignments</li>
<li>Desire to research, study and learn. Basic short essay writing or
coding skills</li>
<li>Self-discipline for independent studies and thinking</li>
<li>WARNING: Do not enroll to this course if you plan to just quickly
copy-paste texts and answers from the Internet. Idea is to actually
LEARN something by researching cloud service concepts and then document
your findings with your own words and thoughts with references</li>
<li>There are alternative practical assignments available for those who
prefer coding and implementing, i.e.&nbsp;doing hands-on assignments</li>

<li>5 ECTS credits equals approximately 135 hours of hands-on
assignments, research, assessment and writing work</li>
<li>You can research and study at your own pace, just don't miss the
critical second-last week (learning diary submission) and last week
(peer reviews) deadlines</li>
<li>Select and answer at least four essay questions from each study week
#1-5 to pass the course with grade one. For most weeks there is a
hands-on alternative assignment available</li>
<li>If you answer essay questions, avoid bullet lists and too short
answers. See the <a href="https://tl.oamk.fi/dl/peer_reviews.html">example here</a></li>
<li>For higher grades 2-5: Select and answer at least four essay
questions from weeks #1-5 (i.e.&nbsp;20 questions or more) AND answer extra,
optional question bundles. You are free to choose the order and amount
of extra question bundles. The more you do extra assignments = better
grade.</li>
<li>Before the week #7 deadline: Save your work to a single PDF file and
use <a href="https://moodle.oulu.fi/">Moodle</a> to submit your answers
for peer reviews</li>
<li>Use learning diary template and follow these instructions <a href="https://tl.oamk.fi/dl/workshop_instructions.html">how to submit the answers</a></li>
<li>Copy-paste selected questions to the template and answer in a way
that your answers clearly show that you have researched and understood
the topics and questions</li>
<li>Do not just copy-paste all answers from the web. Use your own words
and thoughts and document what you have learned. Referencing is strongly
recommended</li>
<li>For practical assignments: Use screenshots, code repositories or
code snippets. Demonstrate that you have done and learned the
assignment</li>
<li>It is not possible to submit any answers after the week #7 deadline.
If you miss this deadline, the course grade will be set as failed</li>
<li>Peer reviews and reflective assessments: After the week #7 deadline,
go to <a href="https://moodle.oulu.fi/">Moodle</a> and study, review,
comment and grade two student submissions randomly assigned to you. <a href="https://tl.oamk.fi/dl/peer_reviews.html">Peer review instructions</a></li>
<li>Peer reviews are mandatory during the last course week!</li>
<li>Week 1-5 bonus infos and assignments are sometimes challenging and
completely optional! Bonus assignments may require significant effort,
research, coding and purchasing or trialing cloud based services</li>

<h3 id="ai-usage-chatgpt-copilot-etc.">AI usage (ChatGPT, Copilot,
etc.)</h3>
<p><strong>Note: You learn more from this course if you avoid or don’t
use AI at all. Course assignments will teach you information technology
core skills and know-how. Remember: AI should be your servant, not your
master.</strong></p>
<p>The use of artificial intelligence is permitted, but it must be
reported: Students are allowed to use artificial intelligence to
research and answer the course assignments, but they must clearly
indicate this. If you use AI tools in your research, describe how you
used the tool. In your answer, provide the prompt you used and then any
portion of the relevant text that was generated in response. You must
comment the AI answer with your own thoughts and words.</p>
<p>If you used AI tool to answer the assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy-paste the prompt (the question, chat) you used with the AI
tool</li>
<li>Do not screenshot and copy-paste the AI answer as image to your
learning diary, but try to validate, research, and edit the AI answer
before answering. Highlight key contents</li>
<li>Add practical example if the answer is something you can easily
demonstrate</li>
<li>Comment the AI answer with your own words and thoughts. For example,
write a 2-5 sentence summary</li>

<h3 id="study-groups-and-the-gilligans-island-rule">Study groups and the
Gilligan's Island Rule</h3>
<p><em>Students are encouraged to study and learn together. Another
student is often the best resource for working out a complex computation
or understanding a difficult concept. However, in (this class) all
documents turned in to fulfill assignments must be the exclusive work of
the person submitting them, unless otherwise stated. In order to allow
students to work together, yet submit assignments that represent their
own thought, the Gilligan's Island rule is adopted.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Gilligan's Island Rule:</strong> <em>You are free to meet
with fellow students(s) and discuss an assignment with them. Writing on
a board or shared piece of paper during the meeting is acceptable;
however, you should not take any written (electronic or otherwise)
record away from the meeting. Everything that you derive from the
collaboration should be in your head. After the meeting, engage in at
least a half-hour of mind-numbing activity (like watching an episode of
Gilligan's Island*), before starting to work on the assignment. This
will assure that you are able to reconstruct what you learned from the
meeting by yourself.</em></p>
<p><em>* Gilligan's Island was a 1960s sitcom that set the standard for
dim-witted TV. Seinfeld or anything more intelligent, e.g.&nbsp;some PBS
programming, also works for this purpose.</em></p>

researching each part and selecting those that give them the desired
balance of power and flexibility. With planning out of the way, they
enjoy the process of assembling the parts into a finished unit. Other

of building applications that are scalable, elastic, and cloud-ready.
Isolated systems allow us to compartmentalize changes, conceptualize
with abstractions, and reuse without side effects. Enforcing simpler and
standard HTTP-based communication will enable us to use existing
infrastructure components, ideas, and resources that drive the Internet
at such a massive scale.</em><br>

<p>If you do this AWS tutorial, you cannot do the extra grade bundle D
because it’s the same assignment. Also, this requires normal, commercial
AWS account.</p>

<p>Note: AWS Wildrydes tutorial application repository updates
occasionally and changes may sometimes require code edits:</p>
<p>(Edit 19.1.2024) Outdated fixes: You should not need to make these

<p><em>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is one of the many offerings
of a cloud provider. It provides raw networking, storage, and compute
that customers can consume as needed. It also includes support services
such as identity and access management (IAM), provisioning, and
inventory systems.</em></p>
<p><em>IaaS allows companies to get rid of all of their hardware and to
rent VMs or physical servers from someone else. This frees up a lot of
people resources and gets rid of processes that were needed for
purchasing, maintenance, and, in some cases, capacity planning.</em></p>
<p><em>IaaS fundamentally changed infrastructure’s relationship with
businesses. Instead of being a capital expenditure benefited from over
time, it is an operational expense for running your business. Businesses
can pay for their infrastructure the same way they pay for electricity
and people’s time. With billing based on consumption, the sooner you get
rid of infrastructure, the smaller your operational costs will
be.</em></p>
<p><em>Hosted infrastructure also made consumable HTTP Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs) for customers to create and manage
infrastructure on demand. Instead of needing a purchase order and
waiting for physical items to ship, engineers can make an API call, and
a server will be created. The server can be deleted and discarded just
as easily.</em></p>
<p><em>Running your infrastructure in a cloud does not make your
infrastructure cloud native. IaaS still requires infrastructure
management. Outside of purchasing and managing physical resources, you
can—and many companies do—treat IaaS identically to the traditional
infrastructure they used to buy and rack in their own data
centers.</em><br>

<p><em>The goal of machine learning is to find patterns in large amounts
of data and to use insights into those patterns to make predictions
about future events or scenarios. It is a particularly hot topic these
days, and most organizations either have started or plan to start
machine-learning initiatives in the near future.</em></p>
<p><em>The future of machine learning lies not just in better algorithms
but also in hybrid data management and machine-learning platforms that
are able to speed machine learning by moving algorithms to the data, and
not the other way around. It also lies in advanced hardware, which is
rapidly evolving. We are seeing faster and more sophisticated
generations of GPUs that will allow you to train machine-learning models
very quickly. This is another reason to go to the cloud, because if you
make an investment in on-premises hardware today, it will take you
longer to move to the next generation of innovation tomorrow.</em></p>
<p><em>We will also see a lot more automation, on both the model
training and monitoring sides. On the training side, AutoML is rapidly
evolving, which will reduce the work overhead for the data scientists
and democratize machine learning and data science even further. On the
monitoring side, we’re entering an age where data science platforms and
cloud providers are beginning to focus more on that aspect of the
machine-learning life cycle.</em></p>
<p><em>Much exciting work is being done in machine learning across a
broad range of industries. In particular, new cost-effective and
infinitely scalable cloud-based platforms are emerging that streamline
businesses’ capabilities to build machine-learning models for data
analytics, data discovery, and data visualizations in a way that
promotes collaboration among data scientists, data engineers, business
analysts, and business users for best business outcomes. The future
looks bright for early adopters of machine learning who are getting
ahead of the curve as well as the competition.</em><br>

<p><em>The Microsoft Azure IoT is an IoT cloud platform. It is a
collection of Microsoft-managed cloud services that connect, monitor,
and control IoT devices to transform business processes. These cloud
services are then further divided into software-as-a-service (SaaS) and
platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions with trade-offs for technical
abstraction, level of customization, and time to market. IoT Central is
a SaaS solution that comes with easy-to-use and preconfigured templates
to start quickly with your IoT project.</em></p>
<p><em>IoT Solution Accelerators is an open source PaaS solution that
has multiple prebuilt solutions. These solutions are provided to
accelerate your development and later allow you to customize the
solution to meet your needs.</em></p>
<p><em>IoT Hub is a PaaS solution and technical foundational of the
preceding offerings. It supports bidirectional communication; for
example, it can command and control communications from the cloud back
to the devices. IoT Hub also supports Android Things via Java
SDK.</em></p>
<p><em>IoT Edge is neither a PaaS nor an SaaS solution. It technically
lets you run cloud intelligence, data analysis, and custom logic
directly on IoT devices; when combined with Edge processing, this can
offer faster processing with low latency and reduce the time and cost of
data travel to the cloud servers.</em><br>

<p>Implement this AWS tutorial: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/">Build
a Serverless Web Application</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Use normal commercial AWS account or create a new free tier trial
AWS account (Note: AWS education account DOES NOT WORK due it being very
limited and not supporting AWS IAM role configurations). New AWS account
activation may take a day or so.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: AWS Wildrydes tutorial application repository updates
occasionally and changes may sometimes require code edits:</p>
<p>(Edit 19.1.2024) Outdated fixes: You should not need to make these
edits/fixes anymore</p>
<p>Not needed anymore: esri-map.js may require a code change around line
70: <a href="https://tl.oamk.fi/cloudservices/dl/aws_microservice_tutorial.png">view.then -&gt;
view.when</a></p>
<p>Not needed anymore: Apparently small ride.html edit fixes the app
(probably this will be fixed in the original repository eventually).
Change the version number from 4.3 to 4.10 in line 95 of ride.html file.
Thank to several students for troubleshooting and pointing this
problem.</p>
